<center><h3>Overview</h3></center>

<!--Below this is the overview text, but written out really long -->
<center><h5>Evansburg State Park is in southcentral Montgomery County between Norristown and Collegeville.
		<br>
			Evansburg offers a significant area of green space and relative solitude in an urbanized area.
		<br>
			Its main natural feature, the Skippack Creek, has dissected the land into ridges and valleys that create feelings of enclosures and provide scenic views.
		<br>
			The first European settlers were Mennonite farmers who powered their industries with the water of the Skippack.
		<br>
 			Even now, mill remnants, mill buildings, and houses from the eighteenth and nineteenth century dot the park landscape and serve as reminders of early American life.
		<br>
			Today, the park is a quilt work of cropland, meadows, old fields, and mature woodlands that attracts day use visitors from the Montgomery County and Philadelphia areas.
		<br>
			People come to the open play fields, picnic areas, trails, golf course, and the relatively tranquil, natural environs.
